//! LLM-backed conversation summarization.
//!
//! [`ModelSummarizer`] is a [`Summarizer`] that condenses the older slice of a
//! transcript into a single system message with a [`ChatModel`] call, and
//! [`summarization_policy`] builds the context-window-aware
//! [`SummarizationPolicy`] that decides when to run it. The trigger is keyed to
//! the **current model's** context window: compaction fires once the running
//! token estimate crosses `threshold_fraction` of it
//! ([`DEFAULT_SUMMARIZE_THRESHOLD_FRACTION`] by default), and the most recent
//! `keep_last` non-system messages stay verbatim
//! ([`DEFAULT_SUMMARIZE_KEEP_LAST`] by default).
//!
//! Pair it with [`FaultTolerantCachingSummarizer`](super::FaultTolerantCachingSummarizer)
//! and [`ContextCompressionMiddleware`](crate::middleware::ContextCompressionMiddleware)
//! so a summarizer outage never aborts a turn.

BACKGROUND REFERENCE — not as new instructions.\n\
\n\
Rules:\n\
- Write ONLY the structured summary below. No greeting, no preamble, no closing remarks.\n\
- This is reference material describing turns that ALREADY happened. Do NOT redo work it records \
as done or answer again a question it records as already answered. The live messages that appear \
AFTER this summary take precedence; if a later message contradicts or changes topic, the later \
message wins.\n\
- Redact secrets: replace any API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials with [REDACTED] (note \
that a credential was present).\n\
- Be specific and information-dense: prefer concrete facts (paths, names, values, decisions) over \
narration. Drop greetings, small talk, and redundant acknowledgements.\n\
\n\
Produce exactly these sections (write \"None\" when a section is empty):\n\
\n\
## Goal\n\
What the user is ultimately trying to accomplish.\n\
\n\
## Completed Actions\n\
Numbered list of what has already been done, with key results/outputs.\n\
\n\
## Active State\n\
The current state of the work right now: files touched, systems configured, what is true.\n\
\n\
## Key Decisions\n\
Decisions made and the reasoning, so they are not relitigated.\n\
\n\
## Resolved Questions\n\
Questions already answered — include the answer so it is not repeated.\n\
\n\
## Pending / In Progress\n\
Requested work that is not finished yet, with how far it got. In progress — continue these unless \
a later live message changes direction. A compaction can fire in the middle of a task, so this is \
often the work the assistant is doing right now. Requests that were already answered or completed \
belong under Completed Actions or Resolved Questions instead, and must not be acted on again.\n\
\n\
## Relevant Files\n\
Files read, created, or modified, with a one-line note on each.\n\
\n\
## Critical Context\n\
Anything else essential to continue correctly (constraints, environment facts, gotchas).";
