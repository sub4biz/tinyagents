# harness::middleware

Cross-cutting extension points that wrap agent, model, and tool execution.

In the recursive harness a sub-agent or sub-graph is just another
agent loop, so the same before/after hooks bracket the parent run *and* every
nested model/tool/agent call beneath it. That uniform wrapping is what lets
concerns like tracing, usage/cost roll-up, and guardrails compose consistently
as models call models and graphs run graphs.

## Extension shapes

- **Lifecycle middleware** (`Middleware` trait) — observes and optionally
  mutates values flowing past fixed points: `before_agent` / `after_agent`,
  `before_model` / `on_model_delta` / `after_model`, `before_tool` /
  `on_tool_delta` / `after_tool`, and `on_error`. Every hook has a no-op
  default, is async, and returns `Result<()>`; an `Err` short-circuits the
  stack.
- **Around-agent middleware** (`AgentMiddleware`) — surrounds a complete run,
  receives the mutable partial `AgentRun`, and can rewrite initial input,
  prepare run-scoped resources, short-circuit, or finalize after either success
  or failure. Host-owned memory, workspace lifecycle, and session policy belong
  here.
- **Around-call middleware** (`ModelMiddleware`, `ToolMiddleware`) —
  surrounds the inner call with a `next` handler (`ModelHandler` /
  `ToolHandler`) instead of only observing before/after values. A wrap
  middleware can proceed (call `next.run(..)` once), short-circuit (never call
  it, returning a replacement `MiddlewareModelOutcome` / `MiddlewareToolOutcome`
  directly), retry (call `next.run(..)` in a loop), or fall back (call it, then
  substitute a response on error). This is the only extension point expressive
  enough for retry/fallback/caching semantics.

All shapes are composed by `MiddlewareStack`, which keeps independent ordered
lists for lifecycle, agent, model, and tool middleware.

## Onion ordering

`before_*` lifecycle hooks run in registration order; `after_*` hooks run in
**reverse** registration order, so the first-registered middleware is the
outermost layer — it sets up first and tears down last. Wrap middleware
compose the same way as a nested onion around the real model/tool call
(`ModelBaseCall` / `ToolBaseCall`), with the first-registered middleware
outermost and the base call innermost.

Every per-middleware hook invocation is bracketed by
`AgentEvent::MiddlewareStarted` / `MiddlewareCompleted` events emitted through
the `RunContext`, so hook activity is independently observable via the event
sink regardless of what a middleware itself records. The pair is always
balanced: a hook that returns `Err` still emits its `MiddlewareCompleted`
before the error short-circuits the stack, so an observer never sees a dangling
`Started`. (The per-delta streaming hook `on_model_delta` is the one deliberate
exception — it emits no bracketing events, to stay cheap on the token hot path.)

## Error handling

The first hook that returns `Err` short-circuits the stack: every
middleware's `Middleware::on_error` is invoked (so all middleware get a chance
to log/redact/react), then the *original* error is returned to the caller.
Errors raised from `on_error` itself are ignored — they cannot mask the root
cause or replace it with a different error.

One failure delivers exactly one `on_error` per middleware. The stack marks the
`RunContext` when it fans a hook failure out, and a driver that also handles the
propagated error (the agent loop does, for failures raised by models, tools, or
the loop itself) skips its own dispatch for that error.

## Public surface

- `Middleware<State, Ctx = ()>` — the lifecycle trait described above.
- `AgentMiddleware<State, Ctx>` / `AgentHandler` / `AgentBaseCall` — the
  complete-run onion used for host-owned behavior and resource lifecycles.
- `ModelMiddleware<State, Ctx>` / `ToolMiddleware<State, Ctx>` — the wrap
  traits, each with a single `wrap_model` / `wrap_tool` method.
  `wrap_tool` and `ToolHandler::run` / `ToolBaseCall::call` take a shared
  `&RunContext` (previously `&mut`; migrate by dropping the `mut`), so a
  multi-call tool batch runs the wrap onion inside each concurrent call. A wrap
  that cannot tolerate overlap returns `false` from
  `ToolMiddleware::concurrent_safe` to keep batches serial. See
  `docs/modules/harness/middleware-tool-wrap.md`.
- `MiddlewareStack<State, Ctx>` — the composer; `push` / `push_model` /
  `push_tool` register middleware, `run_before_agent` / `run_after_agent` /
  `run_wrapped_model` / `run_wrapped_tool` / etc. run them.
- `AgentRun` — the accumulated result of a run (messages, final response,
  structured output, usage, call/step counters) threaded through
  `after_agent`.
- `ModelHandler<'a, State, Ctx>` / `ToolHandler<'a, State, Ctx>` — the `next`
  handle passed to wrap middleware; `.run(ctx, state, request/call)` proceeds
  to the next layer.
- `ModelBaseCall<State, Ctx>` / `ToolBaseCall<State, Ctx>` — the innermost real
  call, supplied by the agent loop as the base of the onion.
- `MiddlewareModelOutcome` / `MiddlewareToolOutcome` — `#[non_exhaustive]`
  result enums wrap middleware resolve to; construct via `.into()` from a
  `ModelResponse` / `ToolResult`.

### Middleware types defined directly in this module (`types.rs`)

These structs are *defined* in `middleware/types.rs` (not `library/`) because
their fields (records, layout cache, counters) are considered part of this
module's core surface — but their constructors and trait impls actually live
in `library/context.rs` and `library/observe.rs` alongside the rest of the
built-in catalog:

- `LoggingMiddleware` — observation-only; counts how often each lifecycle hook
  fires (`HookCounts`, readable via `.counts()`). Emits no events of its own —
  the stack already emits start/completed events.
- `MessageTrimMiddleware` — replaces `request.messages` with the result of
  `summarization::trim_messages` under a configured `TrimStrategy` in
  `before_model`.
- `ContextCompressionMiddleware` — consults a `SummarizationPolicy` in
  `before_model` and is a complete no-op below the context-window threshold;
  above it, condenses older messages via a `Summarizer` (default
  `ConcatSummarizer`) into a summary message, keeps the recent window and
  system messages verbatim, records a `SummaryRecord`, and emits
  `AgentEvent::Compressed`.
- `MicrocompactMiddleware` — the micro-compaction companion to
  `ContextCompressionMiddleware`: blanks the bodies of older tool-result
  messages (keeping the newest `keep_recent` verbatim) instead of summarizing
  chat history, optionally gated on a token budget to preserve the
  prompt-cache prefix.
- `PromptCacheGuardMiddleware` — computes the request's
  `cache::PromptCacheLayout` in `before_model` and records a
  `CacheLayoutEvent` whenever the cacheable segment ids or content change from
  the previous call. For canonical declared layouts, a trimmed or compacted
  history can lose its cached tail while retaining the stable prefix, so it
  does not raise this event. Layouts without a known message boundary check
  the full message stream for byte-prefix preservation; pure tail appends
  remain valid.
- `UsageAccountingMiddleware` — folds each `response.usage` into a running
  `UsageTotals` in `after_model`, readable via `.totals()`.

### Built-in middleware library (`library/`)

A much larger catalog of ready-to-use middleware — retry/timeout/fallback/rate
limiting, budget enforcement, tool policy/allowlisting/selection, human
approval, structured-output validation, dynamic prompts, redaction, and
tracing — lives in `library/` and is re-exported through this module. See
[`library/README.md`](library/README.md) for the full list.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `types.rs` | Every public type: traits, `MiddlewareStack`, and the middleware listed above. |
| `mod.rs` | Behavioral code: `AgentRun` helpers, the stack runner. |
| `library/` | The built-in middleware library — see [`library/README.md`](library/README.md). |
| `mod_tests.rs` | Unit tests (ordering, short-circuiting, each middleware defined in this module). |

## Operational constraints

- Hooks are invoked with `&mut RunContext<Ctx>` and a shared `&State`; a
  middleware must not assume exclusive ownership of `State` — it is read-only
  from the middleware's perspective.
- Because `on_error` failures are swallowed, a middleware must not rely on
  `on_error` for anything beyond best-effort side effects (logging, metrics).
- Wrap middleware that retry `next.run(..)` are responsible for their own
  budget/backoff; the stack does not cap retry attempts.
