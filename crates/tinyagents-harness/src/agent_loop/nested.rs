//! Nested tool calls (C9): the agent-loop side of
//! [`ToolExecutionContext::call_tool`](crate::tool::ToolExecutionContext::call_tool).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A tool future holds only `&RunContext` (the concurrent path runs several at
//! once) and cannot own the harness or the run state, so the nested runner a
//! tool sees is a **channel**: [`ToolCallBase::call`] drives the tool's future
//! and, in the same poll loop, services the nested calls it sends. Servicing
//! borrows exactly what the model-issued path borrows (`&AgentHarness`,
//! `&State`, `&RunContext`), so a nested call runs through the same
//! lookup, validation, host authorization and tool-wrap onion — and, being a
//! plain [`ToolCallBase::call`] itself, can nest again.
//!
//! # What a nested call shares with the run
//!
//! - **Budget**: one `max_tool_calls` pool. The slot is reserved on the shared
//!   atomic in [`crate::limits::LimitTracker`], so concurrent parents cannot
//!   overspend it, and model-issued admission counts reserved nested slots.
//! - **Cancellation and wall clock**: the run's; a cancelled run refuses the
//!   next nested call, and dropping the parent drops its in-flight nested calls
//!   (each gets a `ToolFailed`, so every `ToolStarted` has a terminal event).
//! - **Events**: `ToolStarted`/`ToolCompleted`/`ToolFailed` with
//!   `parent_call_id` (the *immediate* parent), under the id
//!   `<parent call id>/<n>`.
//! - **Effect ledger**: one row per nested call, keyed by the nested id.
//!
//! # What applies to a nested call, exactly
//!
//! Applies: tool lookup and the host allow-list, argument preparation and
//! validation, the approval refusal, [`check_nested_tool`](crate::middleware::Middleware::check_nested_tool) on every
//! registered middleware, host authorization (with
//! `ToolCallRequest::parent_call_id` set), the tool-wrap onion
//! (`ToolMiddleware::wrap_tool`), timeouts, the run budget,
//! [`observe_nested_result`](crate::middleware::Middleware::observe_nested_result) after the call.
//!
//! Does **not** apply: `Middleware::before_tool` / `after_tool` proper (they
//! take `&mut RunContext`, which a tool future holding `&RunContext` cannot
//! lend), so enforcement that lives only in `before_tool` is *not* applied
//! unless the middleware also implements `check_nested_tool`; the progress
//! gate; host output screening; a result's `ToolControl`.
//!
//! # What a nested call deliberately does not do
//!
//! - **No transcript rows.** A nested call is not answered to the provider, so
//!   it must not appear in tool-call/tool-result pairing. A capped summary is
//!   attached to the *parent's* result metadata instead.
//! - **No deferral.** The parent is mid-execution, so a nested call that would
//!   need approval (or be deferred) fails with a clear error.
//! - **Unbounded refusals.** After [`MAX_NESTED_REFUSALS`] refused nested
//!   calls a parent gets no more answers but a refusal, so a tool cannot loop
//!   on free refusals (a refused call releases its budget slot).
