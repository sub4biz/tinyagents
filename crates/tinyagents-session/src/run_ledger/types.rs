//! Serde record types for the run ledger: background agent runs, workflow
//! runs, run events/telemetry, and agent-team coordination (teams, members,
//! tasks).
//!
//! These mirror the tables created by migration 2 (and later) in
//! `crate::migrations`. Each persisted record type (`AgentRun`, `WorkflowRun`,
//! `RunEvent`, `RunTelemetry`, `AgentTeam`, `AgentTeamMember`,
//! `AgentTeamTask`) has a paired `*Upsert` type carrying only the fields a
//! caller supplies — timestamps and derived fields are filled in by
//! `super::ops` rather than the caller. List request/response pairs
//! (`*ListRequest` / `*ListResponse`) are the shapes `super::ops`'s listing
//! functions accept and return, and double as the RPC-facing schema for
//! hosts that expose the ledger over an API.
